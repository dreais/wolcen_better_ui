## All jokes aside...

[What is the actual mod?](https://streamable.com/4j0ni)

It's an UI "designer" as I like to call it - you can freely modify, move, scale the existing UI without removing any of it's functions. You can even hide them by putting them outside of the screen!

Still a work in progress though, you can follow the progress on our Discord, [Wolcen Modding](https://discord.gg/n6D8N3q).

### How does it work?

(will it* for now)

You'll be assigned an unique ID, and have an user.profile created on a distant server containing your UI settings. Everytime you start the game, it'll gather the settings and apply them. The in-game menu is merely here to change these with placeholders element, but once you reload the game all settings are "downloaded"!
